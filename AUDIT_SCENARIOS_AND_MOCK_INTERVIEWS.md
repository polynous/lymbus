## üîç **SCENARIO 1: RISK MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT**

### **Auditor Opening Statement**
*"I'd like to understand how your organization identifies, assesses, and treats information security risks. Can you walk me through your risk management process?"*

### **Ideal Response Script**
```
INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGER:

"Certainly. We follow a structured risk management approach aligned with ISO 27001:2022 requirements:

1. RISK IDENTIFICATION:
   - We maintain a comprehensive asset inventory covering our web application, 
     student database, QR access systems, and user data
   - We identify threats and vulnerabilities for each asset category
   - Our team conducts quarterly risk assessments

2. RISK ANALYSIS:
   - We use a 5x5 Impact √ó Likelihood matrix
   - Risk scores range from 1-25, categorized as Low, Medium, High, Very High, or Critical
   - Each risk is assigned an owner for accountability

3. RISK TREATMENT:
   - We have documented treatment plans for all identified risks
   - Treatment options include: Accept, Mitigate, Transfer, or Avoid
   - All high and critical risks have approved mitigation plans

Let me show you our risk register in the system..."
```

### **Technical Demonstration**
```bash
# Show risk dashboard
GET /api/compliance/dashboard

# Display specific risk assessments
GET /api/compliance/risks?risk_level=high

# Show risk treatment plans
GET /api/compliance/risks/{risk_id}
```

### **Follow-up Questions & Responses**

**Q: "How often do you review your risks?"**
**A:** "We conduct formal risk reviews quarterly, with ad-hoc assessments triggered by system changes, incidents, or new threat intelligence. All reviews are documented with dates and outcomes."

**Q: "Who approves risk treatment decisions?"**
**A:** "Risk owners propose treatment plans, which are reviewed by the Information Security Manager and approved by senior management. This ensures appropriate resource allocation and management commitment."

   - We follow the principle of least privilege

2. AUTHENTICATION MECHANISMS:
   - Strong password requirements enforced
   - JWT token-based authentication with expiration
   - Rate limiting: 5 login attempts per 15 minutes
   - IP blocking for repeated failed attempts

3. PRIVILEGED ACCESS MANAGEMENT:
   - Administrative access requires approval workflows
   - Privileged sessions are monitored and logged
   - Time-limited elevated access for specific tasks
   - Regular access reviews conducted quarterly

4. ACCESS MONITORING:
   - All access attempts are logged and audited
   - Suspicious activity automatically flagged

   - Incident response team activated if severity is Medium or higher

2. INVESTIGATION (15 minutes - 2 hours):
   - Collect relevant logs and evidence
   - Interview affected user and witnesses
   - Analyze system logs for indicators of compromise
   - Determine scope and impact of incident

3. CONTAINMENT (Immediate):
   - Isolate affected systems or accounts if necessary
   - Change compromised credentials
   - Implement temporary security measures
   - Prevent further damage or data loss

4. RESOLUTION (Variable timeline):
   - Address root cause of incident
   - Implement corrective actions
   - Restore normal operations
   - Verify security controls effectiveness

5. POST-INCIDENT (Within 72 hours):
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update procedures if necessary
   - Report to regulatory authorities if required (GDPR Article 33)
   - Brief management on incident outcomes

Let me show you our incident management system..."
